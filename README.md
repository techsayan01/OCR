# OCR
This is a simple HTML file which converts image to text (OCR). This is built in native JS for fun during lunch time. One can upload the image in the webpage from the filesystem, crop the region of interest and get the text out of it. 

This page has dependencies on these libraries taken from CDN links (so need to worry to download any JS library)

# teserract.js
# Cropper.js
# OpenCV.js

Please check the library links if it doesn't work.

Feel free to contribute and use it.
